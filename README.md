# Wizard-Side-Scrolling-Game


I. Project Overview -
We will play with the wizard who flies in the sky. Bugs will appear from the right and head towards us. We score
points by shooting them with fireballs. If we hit them, they die. If a bug hits us the game is over. In the end our game will look like the screenshot below.
